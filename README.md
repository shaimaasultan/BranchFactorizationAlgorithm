# Tree Factorization Algorithm

#New Tree Factorization algorithm based on prime number distributions and Zeta Series Sum

This is the full matrix for factoring and finding the primes but in order to find all primes less than number [N] we 
do not need to use modules for all numbers in the list we only need to construct smaller matrix from [N rows and 
M columns] where M in Branch (1) list and <= sqrt(n). 
Given number N. Get list of prime number up until number N.
0- Initiate Branch (1) & Branch (2) (two sequence lists (+6, +12, +10)) up until number <= given number
N
And as our [7] branch list is limited list and its length approximate N/4.
